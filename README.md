# The Cave

### A 3D ASCII Renderer in the Terminal

**The Cave** is a terminal-based 3D renderer that uses ASCII art to display `.obj` files. Inspired by Plato's Allegory of the Cave, this project serves as a reflection on how our modern understanding of the world is shaped by what we see on screens and read in text rather than by direct experience.

In **The Cave**, 3D objects are reduced to simple ASCII representations, much like how shadows on the wall of Plato's cave represented reality for the prisoners. Similarly, todayâ€™s screens and text shape our perception, making this project a nod to both ancient philosophy and contemporary digital life.

## Features
- Renders 3D `.obj` files directly in the terminal.
- Uses ASCII characters to approximate depth and shading.
- Supports basic camera transformations (rotation, scaling).
- Lightweight, runs entirely in the command line.
- No external graphical interface, sticking to the minimalist philosophy.
